# magento-php7-totals-fix

## Abstract
Here's a magento module to solve magento issues with totals calculation for php7.
The issues I've experienced in particular were that taxes have been added twice to the grand total for [pay with amazon](https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/login-and-pay-with-amazon-advanced-payment-apis-for-europe.html) module on the amazonpayments checkout page.
  
## Credits
The solution was provided by [archigrafix](http://magento.stackexchange.com/users/34992/archigrafix) on http://magento.stackexchange.com/a/97107/35665 - So this is simply the fix packed into a module.

## Background
 PHP7 has a new implementation of uasort algorithm which may behave differently for sorting elements with identical order.
